# Talk and Walk Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We want to make participation in our Talk and Walk 
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity
and orientation.

In attending we pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy experience.

## Our Standards

Examples of behaviour that contributes to a positive environment include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the
  overall community
* Repeating information in conversations to others only under the Chatham House Rule:
  participants are free to use and repeat information from conversations, but no identifying information of the speaker, nor that of any other participant in the conversation, may be revealed.

Examples of unacceptable behaviour include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or
  advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Repeating or publishing others' private information or opinions 
  gathered during a walk without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional or civilised social setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

## Enforcement
